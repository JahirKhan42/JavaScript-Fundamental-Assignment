The key difference between JavaScript and HTML  in their respective roles and functionalities within web development:

A)HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

-HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
-It defines the elements and layout of a web page using tags such as <html>, <head>, <body>, <p>,
<div>, <span>, etc.
-HTML is primarily responsible for displaying static content on a web page, such as text, images,
links, and multimedia.
-It provides the foundation upon which web content is built and styled.

B)JavaScript:

-JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and functionality to web pages.
-It is executed by web browsers and allows for event handling, DOM manipulation, asynchronous communication, and more.
-JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML documents or included as external script files.
-It enables developers to create interactive features such as form validation, animations, sliders,    dynamic content updates, and AJAX requests.


Here are an example that demonstrate the use of both javascript and HTML in a typical web development scenario : 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>interactive web page</title>
    <script>
        function greet() {
            var name = prompt("What's your name?");
            alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="greet()">Say Hello</button>
</body>
</html>
