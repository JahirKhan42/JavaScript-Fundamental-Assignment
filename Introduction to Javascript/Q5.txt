Importance of Comments:

1)Code Documentation: Comments serve as a form of documentation, helping developers understand the logic, intentions, and usage of different parts of the codebase.

2)Collaboration: When working on a project with multiple developers, comments can facilitate collaboration by providing insights into the code for others who might not be familiar with it.

3)Debugging and Maintenance: Comments can aid in debugging and maintaining code by offering hints or explanations that make it easier to identify and fix issues.

4)Code Readability: Well-commented code is more readable, making it easier for anyone, including yourself, to revisit the code later and understand its purpose and functionality.

5)Temporary Disabling: Comments can be used to temporarily disable lines or blocks of code during development without completely removing them. This can be useful for testing alternative implementations.


Single-Line Comments:
Single-line comments are used for short annotations or explanations on a single line.

// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Initializing a variable with the value 10

Multi-Line Comments:
Multi-line comments are useful for adding more extensive explanations, comments over multiple lines, or temporarily disabling code.

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It spans multiple lines and can be used for detailed explanations.
*/

let a = 5;
let b = 7;

/*
  The following code calculates the sum of variables a and b.
  This is a simple example for demonstration purposes.
*/
let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum);
